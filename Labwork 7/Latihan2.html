        <h1>PTIK FKIP UNS</h1>
        <p>The <span class="highlight">Faculty of Teacher Training and Education, Sebelas Maret University</span>,
        Surakarta is an Educational Personnel <span class="highlight">Education Institution (LPTK)</span> which has 24 study programs in 6 majors.
        Each study program has its own characteristics in producing <span class="highlight">superior, strong and intelligent educational staff.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
        The <span class="highlight"> Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK)</span> study program is planned to take shelter in the management of the <span class="highlight"> Engineering and Vocational Education (PTK)</span> department. This placement revises our previous statement, where the PTIK study program is under the P.MIPA department. 
        PTIK is a study program that will produce graduates who are <span class="highlight"> prioritized to teach in vocational/vocational programs</span>.
        So, it would be better if PTIK was under the PTK department which oversees vocational programs such as <span class="highlight"> Building Engineering Education</span>, and 
        <span class="highlight"> Mechanical Engineering Education</span>. To meet the needs of lecturers in the field of information technology that
        cannot be met by the PTK department, PTIK will conduct<span class="highlight"> resource sharing with the mathematics study program</span>.
